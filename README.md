## Network Expansion Framework project for Python and C++ (CPPY Network Expansion Framework)
This implementation of the Network Expansion Algorithm deals with the elapsed time issues on large-scale or global metabolic networks. Calculating every biosynthetical potential (scope) of every single compound or in combination with other ones (like cofactors) reveals largely increased runtimes over durations of hours, depending on the used hardware. Increased runtimes slow down analyzing and modelling processes and errors, i.e. due to erroneous presets of the analysis, are more devastating as repeating the analysis process is far more punishing and can be a heavy obstacle for the programmer's patience and motivation. As more efficient hardware is not available all time the implementation of a code, that keep elapsed times at a minimum at large-scaled networks, was successfully implemented. It cut the runtime by up to 98% and the resulting data was completely prepared for any subsequent analysis. However, the program is restricted in some functions and is not sufficiently handy for an alltime use without deeper instructions of the developer. Thus, we are currently working on modifying the code for an easier use and as a part of the MOPED module, developed by Saadat et al. Futhermore we are aiming to extend the functionality and increase the efficiency.
